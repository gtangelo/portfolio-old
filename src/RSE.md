# My time with RSE

If you asked me where I discovered my passion for web development, the STEM Leaders Program would probably be a place which sparked my interest in the field. Perhaps, if I had never had joined the program to begin with, I would never been able to learn so much as of today. I was first introduce to this program through a post on the UNSW Discussion Facebook Group. At first, what Real Skills Eduction promoted was "bridging the gaps between classrooms and the workplace". This seems interesting but at the same time daunting for a first year with barely any experience in programming before university, only learning the fundamentals of C previously. Nevertheless, I tried to jump straight in hoping that I may get something out of it and what an experience has it been.


## The First Steps In
As I received an email that I successfully made it in to the program, I was excited to be in. 

The STEM Leaders Program was 2 weeks of intense work for both myself and the team I was working with. From my experience, it was filled with workshops that helped upskill myself professionally and on a personal level (i.e. emotional intelligence, team leadership, team management, interview skills, etc. )
