        About Me
        <p>
          Hello, world! I'm Gabriel Ting, a penultimate student
          currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I am a well 
          versed individual, striving to complete tasks beyond expectations. Through
          my interest in coding, I strive to become a web developer as a career.
          Beside my academic excellence, I look forward to new opportunities that
          help me develop further both professionally and personally. I aim to actively
          participate in societies and events such as my time with Enactus UNSW or through
          other various up skilling programs such as the STEM Leaders Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I love exploring new fields of computer science and learn
          more of what programming has to offer. Other than that, I love exploring
          the city and playing fun video games :)
        </p>
